### 2. JOB SECTION

* For companies, it becomes difficult to find the people who are intelligent enough to be hired. The work for the companies also increases to find the people who can fulfill their requirements.

* For a job applicant it is very difficult to find the right organization which offers great Perks & Benefits according to their requirement.

* Time consumption also plays major role for job applicant if they get late due to some reasons they might loose their chance of interview which will throw a bad impact on the applicant‚Äôs profile.

## Existing System:

**When existing career guidance systems were studied , we found following drawbacks.**

* Almost every career guiding system is ***Paid.***
* They are limited to some specific sectors only.
* They do not provide a clear path to achieve a definite goal.
* Only few professions are mentioned.
* They do not show job opportunities associated with different professions.
